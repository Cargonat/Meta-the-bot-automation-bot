# Meta, the bot automation bot
A bot for managing my other bots running on my headless raspberry pi via a discord server

## Tasks
- Keep my other bots running
- Pipe their output and errors to a discord server
  - each in a separate channel
- allow me to control my raspberry pi directly similar to the [telegram shell bot](https://github.com/botgram/shell-bot)
